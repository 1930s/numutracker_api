# Numu Tracker API v3

This is the home for the third version of the Numu Tracker API. If you're not familiar with what Numu Tracker is, check out [the iOS App repository](https://www.github.com/amiantos/numutracker_ios) to see what it is all about.

API v3 is meant to be a cleaner, easier to maintain version of the API to support v2 of the iOS app. It's also meant to have several improvements over v2, namely that when a release has multiple artists, the release is not duplicated.

# To Install
1. `git clone https://github.com/amiantos/numutracker_api.git`
